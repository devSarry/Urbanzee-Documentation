# Storyboarding UX
We need to document the UI and UX to help crystalize design and make sure everyone working on the project has the same working definition of the design.

This document will be used by anyone involved in the impementation or design of the charts but also to give Urbanzee a better idea of what is going to be achived.

We will do most of the work using pen and paper. Maybe also create some reference charts using excel.

# Requirments
Each storyboard will have be for a user with and a given scenario. 
For example:
>A city official needs to see the carbon emision near the bus station

Create a *linear* storyboard of UX process to get to the end result.
